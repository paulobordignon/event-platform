<h2> :book: About</h2>

![ProjectImage!](./src/assets/project.png)

In this project we use hygraph which is a graphql CMS so we don't need to create a backend. Graphql codegen was used to automatically generate typings and hooks based on queries and mutations. Application icons were obtained through phosphor. To display the videos, the lib vime was used.
